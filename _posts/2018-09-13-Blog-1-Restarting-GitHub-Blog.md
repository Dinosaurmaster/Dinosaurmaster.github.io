  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I thought I would struggle because in year seven and eight after a lot of hard work in writing the blogs I had managed to break the blog page so I was unable to post them but this time I persevered and i have done a lot more than I had expected to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned my friend Luke on a few things and because of that I didn't break my GitHub page like I have before. Me being cautious and asking for help when I needed it probably saved me a lot of time looking through a load of code looking for a problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>While I did ask Luke a few questions after a while I decided that I wanted to do some of the work all by myself. I am probably most proud of this work because I used my own knowledge only.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on my past attempts to create a GitHub page and because they had pretty much all failed i worked really hard not to make some of my previous mistakes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I felt like I really got engaged with the work this time round. Normally I just decide that it is difficult and donâ€™t try very hard. However this time I really got engaged and I am proud of what I achieved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have got engaged straight from the get go instead of being slow to start because of previous bad experiences with building a GitHub blog. I probably should have done a little bit more of the work on my own, because I was worried about breaking it like I have before I asked Luke for quite a lot of help when I probably could have found out the answer for myself. </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Getting straight on with the work would help me to get a lot more work done. I could also do more of the work by myself instead of always asking straight away. I could use the resources that are available to me so that my work can improve and I can be more independent.</td>
