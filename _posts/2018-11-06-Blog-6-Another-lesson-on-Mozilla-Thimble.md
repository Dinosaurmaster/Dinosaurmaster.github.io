    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>After a lot of trouble last week I persevered through this week in order to try and catch up with the rest of the class.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Once again I had to ask the people around me questions about the instructions and how I should complete them.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I probably need to work a bit more independently because I am falling behind and that is a problem. I think that if I do more on my own I might be able to understand it more and therefore be able to catch up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected on last week and realised that I would have to work harder if I wanted to catch up with everyone else.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I really tried to get engaged this week because I feel that it will really help me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Once again something that could have gone better is if we were aloud to stay on Github. After two previous years of Github I was finally not making many mistakes and was keeping up with everyone else. I was getting used to It but it did take a long time and I do not have that long this time. I would have liked to finish the first tutorial but the blog posting is really confusing me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to really work on getting my head around the blog posting system on Mozilla Thimble, I can do this by asking questions and getting really focused on working out how to post blogs.</td>
