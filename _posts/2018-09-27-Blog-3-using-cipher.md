    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Even after help from some of my friends I still struggled to do it but I worked all through the lesson and eventually I completed the task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to ask Mr Keen for help for the first time. He showed me how to do it and even though I could not understand all of what he said I did question him about some things and I think I understand a bit better now.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Unfortunately because I did not understand how to do the task I had to spend most of the lesson ask for help. So I did not do to much work independently.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I had to reflect on the last lesson to try and remember as much of the info we were told last week. I needed to remember as much as possible so that I could do as much as possible on my own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to get engaged so that I could take in as much info from Mr Keen as possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have been able to do more of the work myself, this would help me next week because I would have an easier time of keeping up with the lesson. I felt like i was falling behind a bit and not really getting all of the work we were doing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to try and understand more of what Mr Keen is saying so that I wont keep falling behind. I need to make sure that I listen to absolutely everything that my teacher says. I also need to make sure that I listen to what Mr Keen says at the start of the lesson. If I get engaged right from the start then I might be able to keep up with the lesson.</td>
