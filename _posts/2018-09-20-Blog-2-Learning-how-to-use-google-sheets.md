    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Even though I was trying hard getting it to work was still difficult. So I persevered and if I had had an extra five minutes I probably would have finished. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questions some of the people around me when I was struggling. These questions mostly asking about a specific detail and if it had to be changed from what I had put down.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I asked questions to find out a couple of things but it was then up to me to use what I had been told to complete the task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I did not really reflect much during the lesson because this was the first lesson doing this.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I really had to get engaged because as I said this was our first lesson and I had to get at least some idea of what we were going to be doing for this lesson and the rest of the half term.</td>

    <td>If had understood it earlier on in the lesson then I probably would have been able to complete the whole task. We also had to create three or four alphabets one which was the normal alphabet and the other two, three or four were ciphers. When doing this I wasted a fair amount of time creating them because I had only realised by the third one that I could just copy and paste most of the previous alphabet and then add in the missing letters.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I just need to concentrate on the actual task and not other things that could be added in later if there is time. I should, now that i have a better understanding of what we are doing, get on with as much of the work on my own as possible. I probably need to get ever so slightly more engaged just so that I can get on with the task easier and quicker because I have a better understanding.</td>
