    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Before this week I had not actually finished the task set in the lesson so I was determined to do it this time. I persevered even though I was not really expecting to finish, but I did.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>To make sure I finished the task I questioned both Mr Keen and my friends so that I could be saws quick and efficient as possible.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I needed to be independent so that this task completion is not a one time. The plan is to carry on like this and complete the task week.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I tried not to think about previous weeks because they were mostly failures. I focused as much as possible on this new opportunity. So I did not really reflect in that lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I had to really engage when Mr Keen was talking so that I would understand the task. Then I had to get engaged with the work and not let myself be distracted because I am slow at working so I couldn't afford to lose any time.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would like to be quicker at work so that I don't have to be in an intense working trance, I would like to be  able to be more relaxed as this might even improve my work a bit. It took me  a while ,even with me blocking out as many distractions as possible and asking a couple of questions, to understand what we had to do how we were supposed to do it.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I am going to try and relax a bit more so that my quality of work improves but I still need to make sure I am being quick and efficient so that I finish the task in time, therefore not being left behind the class and getting stuck when things get harder.</td>
