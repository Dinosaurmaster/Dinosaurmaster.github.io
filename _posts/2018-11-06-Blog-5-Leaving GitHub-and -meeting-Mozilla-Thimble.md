    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>It was difficult this week because it was a new website with different systems. But I had to persevere or i would fall behind.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to ask the people around me lots of questions about what the tutorial meant because I was struggling to understand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I needed to do some of the work on my own so that I would be able to understand everything that we were taught as the weeks progressed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I made a few mistakes which I was able to reflect on and hopefully not make again. However my inexperience with Mozilla Thimble did not give much to think back on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>To understand this new Github like programme I had to get engaged so that I could really understand it.</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I would have liked to finish the first tutorial but I was slow to understand some of the instructions which took a lot of time up. I got about two thirds of the way through when the lesson ended. I would have preferred to stay on Github because I was getting quite good at it so I dont think this has been a good thing for my learning.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to speed up a bit and try and reach my target next lesson. I need to try and get used to Mozilla Thimble as. This will probably be the thing that we will use for the rest of the year. To understand it I will have to get more engaged listen to everything the teacher says and try to pick up the instructions a bit quicker.</td>
